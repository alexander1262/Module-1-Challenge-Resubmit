# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

In order to fulfill the requirements of this project I created 2 media queries with 1 set at 992px and the other at 768px

- The first media query which was set at 992 was used to extend the display boxes of the content class boxes so the text will all fit in each box
- I also extended the height of the header box and set the unordered list elements of the seo class to flex column with an alignment right so they stay inside the box and away from the title

- Lastely I shrunk the text of the benefit class titles so they will fit on smaller screens

- The second media query was used to hide the images from the benefit class as they do not fit on very small screens
